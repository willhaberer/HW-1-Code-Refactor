# HW-1-Code-Refactor

The site seen below was given to myself fully designed with a both a index.html and style.css file.

My task was to refactor the code to eliminate redundency and overall increase efficiency while not changing the appearence of the page

The only edit to the page's appereance made by myself was to add a Favicon image to the title
